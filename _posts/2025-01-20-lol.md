# How to be a Sigma
to be a sigma, one must endure massive hardships, as massive as Ninja's low taper fade.

One must then acquire a chopped chin, which requires 2 rizzmases of looksmaxxing.

After that, you must buy property in Egypt.  
And to do that, you shall face the legendary eye of rah.

After acquiring the property, hire the building's management to manage it for you while you travel to the Himalayan mountains to give the Chill Grinch a low taper fade.

Doing so will make you the true undisputed sigma of the pack, and your reign will be undisputed.
